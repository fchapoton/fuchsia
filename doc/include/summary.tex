{\bf PROGRAM SUMMARY}

\begin{small}
\noindent

{\em Program Title:}
    \fuchsia{}

{\em Authors:}
    O.~Gituliar and V.~Magerya

{\em Program obtainable from:}
    \url{https://github.com/gituliar/fuchsia/}

{\em Journal Reference:}
    %Leave blank, supplied by Elsevier.

{\em Catalogue identifier:}
    %Leave blank, supplied by Elsevier.

{\em Licensing provisions:}
    ISC license

{\em Programming language:}
    \python 2.7

{\em Operating system:}
    Linux or any other supported by \sage

{\em RAM:}
    Dependent upon the input data. Expect hundreds of megabytes.

{\em Keywords:}
    Computer algebra, Moser-reduction

{\em Classification:}
    5 Computer Algebra, 11.1 High Energy Physics and Computing

{\em External routines/libraries:}
    \href{http://www.sagemath.org/}{\sage} (version 7.0 or higher)

{\em Nature of problem:}
    \ldots{}

{\em Solution method:}
    Algorithm by R. Lee \cite{Lee15}.

{\em Restrictions:}
    Not all systems of differential equations can be transformed
    in the proposed way because some systems are irreducible
    and the reducibility of some others can not be determined.
    \fuchsia{} is designed to report if the input belongs to
    one of these cases.

{\em Running time:}
    Dependent upon the input data size and complexity. Around
    a minute in total for the example $8\times8$ matrix on a PC
    with a 2GHz Intel Core i5 processor.
