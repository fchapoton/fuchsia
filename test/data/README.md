This directory contains Moser-reducible matrices and their irreducible forms
obtained with Fuchsia. In particular we have:

  - git_410 -- initial matrix
  - git_410_`i` -- reduced form of git_410 in the point x by reduce_at_one_point
        algorithm run `i` times
  - git_`p1'_`p2'_`p3' -- reduced form of git_410 in the points p1, p2, p3 by
        maple_super_reduce
