*Fuchsia* is a reducer of differential equations for multiloop
master integrals.

In concrete terms, let's say you have a system of differential
equations of this form:

    d/dx J = M(x, epsilon) * J,

    where J is a column vector of unknown functions,
          M is a matrix of rational functions,
          x is a free variable,
          epsilon is an infinitesimal parameter

*Fuchsia* will, if possible, transform this system to an equivalent
Fuchsian system of this form:

    d/dx J' = epsilon * S(x) * J'

... with the transformation itself defined by matrix T like this:

    J = T * J'

Such a transformation is useful, because you can now easilly
find J' (and therefore, J) as a series in epsilon.

To find this transformation *Fuchsia* uses algorithm developed
by Roman Lee [1].
