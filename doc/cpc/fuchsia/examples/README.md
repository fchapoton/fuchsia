In this directory you will find assorted selection of matrices
and their reduced versions.

The fully reduced matrices are marked with "--reduced" suffix,
fuchsified matrices are marked with "--fuchsified", normalized
with "--normalized". Suffixes "--m" and "--t" denote the matrices
themselves and the transformation matrices correspondingly.

Some of the examples here either can not be fully reduced in
principle, or are too difficult for Fuchsia. Those examples are
left without a "--reduced" version.
